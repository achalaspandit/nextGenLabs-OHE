MOTIVATION TO CHOSE A PROBLEM :
The problem statement 1 defined how twgraph algorithms has to be implemented using any JavaScript Framework. To begin with what motivated us was that we were excited to implement graph algorithms on JavaScript since we had never thought of using a scripting language to implement algorithms. And also since we had not worked with web technologies before, we wanted to choose a problem statement that we are familiar and comfortable with.  


WHAT WE LEARNT :
TECHNICAL:
We started with understanding the basics of JavaScript and moving on with learning a little about the JavaScript framework Nodejs , mainly it's file systems. We then brushed through HTML and CSS with the necessary topics needed for the project. Later we learnt how to work with git version control. Finally we learnt a lot of concepts and techniques while debugging the errors we encountered.
NON TECHNICAL: 
Since all the concepts used were new to us, we first started off by splitting the project into smaller tasks and started working on them initially. We split the tasks among the two so that we could learn faster and teach each other. After completing each of the smaller tasks we finally integrated them together. We worked together as a team and tried to speak to many people when we had doubts. At every step we kept each other motivated in spite of the obstacles.


THE THOUGHT PROCESS: 
Our idea was to design our web page such that has two options and lets the user selects an algorithm and upload the adjacency matrix for a graph of their choice and get the corresponding output. As we were working along with node.js we noticed that the file operations we used werenâ€™t interpreted by the browser and we were getting errors. We then tried out many ways to integrate such that it could understand require() and fs statements. We used browserify which is an open source JavaScript tool that allows us to use node.js modules. Even after that we encountered some problems. However the code executes without any errors on command prompt. We discovered some other means of working with files but due to time constraints and internals we couldn't try that out. Overall it has been a very fruitful process learning and implementing.
